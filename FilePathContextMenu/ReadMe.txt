This is a self-installing program which adds four right-click context menues to the Windows Explorer.

Two for files and two for folders:
Copy File Name, Copy File Path
Copy Folder Name, Copy Folder Path
The name or complete path is copied to the windows clipboard for use in a subsequent paste operation.

To install this program:
1 - place the FilePathContextMenu.exe file in any folder.
2 - execute FilePathContextMenu.exe (one way is with a double-left-click). This will add the four entries
to the Windows Registry.

That is all there is to it. 

To move this program:
1 - move the file to a new folder.
2 - execute FilePathContextMenu.exe (one way is with a double-left-click). This will update the four entries
to the Windows Registry.

To uninstall this program:
1 - execute FilePathContextMenu.exe -uninstall. This will remove the four Registry entries.
2 - delete file FilePathContextMenu.exe
